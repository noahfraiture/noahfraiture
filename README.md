# 👋 Hi there, I'm Noah!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer, currently studying CS with a major in cybersecurity and software development. I love discovering new languages and technologies. Here you'll find some of my projects, collaborations, and code experiments.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I find useful. If you have a project that I want to use and it lacks something that I want, I will likely make a PR
